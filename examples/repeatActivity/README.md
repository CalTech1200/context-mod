# Repeat Activity

The **Repeat Activity** rule will check for patterns of repetition in an Author's Submission/Comment history. Consult the [schema](https://json-schema.app/view/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FRepeatActivityJSONConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Freddit-context-bot%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2FSchema%2FApp.json) for a complete reference of the rule's properties.
